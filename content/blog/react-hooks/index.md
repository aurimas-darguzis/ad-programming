Hooks were added in React with 16.8 version. Essentialy, hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class. What's another good thing is, that this new feature is completely optional - you don't have to rewrite your application, and it's backwards compatible.

## What is a hook?

Hooks are JavaScript functions. They let you "hook into" the React state and use lifecycle features from function components. Important thing to note here, that Hooks doesn't work in React classes at all, only in functional components. React introduced built-in hooks that we can all use - basic hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` and additional ones: `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useDebugValue`.
